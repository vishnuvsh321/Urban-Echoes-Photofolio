# Urban Echoes – Smartphone Photofolio

**Urban Echoes** is a photo series that captures the untold stories and visual rhythms of city life, all shot using a smartphone. This project documents the beauty in everyday moments — from fleeting gestures to still textures — and presents the urban landscape as a canvas of contrasts: movement and stillness, chaos and calm.

## 📸 Project Overview

- **Camera Used**: Smartphone only
- **Subjects**: Architecture, people, markets, street life, shadows, reflections
- **Style**: Natural, documentary
- **Tools**: Manual camera settings, mobile editing apps

## 🎯 Objective

To explore how smartphone photography can be a powerful medium to tell authentic, human-centered stories from the streets — and to prove that compelling photography doesn’t always require professional gear.

## 🖼️ Highlights

- "Two boys, one bike, and a quiet street echoing with untold stories."
- "Hands meet over fresh catch, where city streets become marketplaces of trust."
- "Tiny hands, big wheel, dreams set in motion."
- "Hand in hand, between traffic and time, love walks quietly."

## 💡 Final Reflection

> "The city is more than buildings and roads — it is a living storybook made of fleeting moments, textures, and silent narratives. Urban Echoes helped me see the extraordinary in the ordinary."

## 🔍 Future Improvements

If revisited, I'd explore:
- Long exposure and low-light photography
- Night scenes capturing the city's mood
- Deeper narrative series around specific city subcultures
